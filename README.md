# Social Network API

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 


## Description

The application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

Express.js is used for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. JavaScript Data object was used to format timestamps.

That application is not deployed, however the link to the video is provided below to be able to demonstrate the API functionality using Insomnia tool.
